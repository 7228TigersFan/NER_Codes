There is no curse in Elvish , Entish , or the tongues of Men for this treachery .
For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all .
The time of the Elves …  is over . Do we leave Middle-Earth to its fate ? Do we let them stand alone ?
Mordor . The one place in Middle-Earth we don’t want to see any closer . And it’s the one place we’re trying to get to . It’s just where we can’t get . Let’s face it , Mr . Frodo , we’re lost .
After Melkor’s defeat in the First Age , Sauron became the second Dark Lord and strove to conquer Arda by creating the Rings .
Gandalf , dwarves , and Mr . Baggins ! We are met together in the house of our friend and fellow conspirator , this most excellent and audacious Hobbit–may the hair on his toes never fall out ! All praise to his wine and ale !
Deep down here by the dark water lived old Gollum , a small slimy creature . I don’t know where he came from , nor who or what he was . He was Gollum .
I am Gandalf the White . And I come back to you now … at the turn of the tide .
I’m glad to be with you , Samwise Gamgee … here at the end of all things .
The Ring has awoken , it’s heard its masters call .
But the fat Hobbit , he knows . Eyes always watching .
