Romeo , Romeo ! wherefore art thou Romeo ?
Friends , Romans , countrymen , lend me your ears : I come to bury Caesar , not to praise him .
There are more things in heaven and earth , Horatio , than are dreamt of in your philosophy .
The fault , dear Brutus , lies not within the stars , but in ourselves , that we are underlings .
To be , or not to be ; that is the question ; Whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer ; The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune , Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
Alas , poor Yorick ! I knew him , Horatio , a fellow of infinite jest , of most excellent fancy . He hath bore me on his back a thousand times , and now how abhorr’d in my imagination it is ! My gorge rises at it . . .
